Description of each file in GitHub  
（1）Train_MATLAB: Contains the training code based on MATLAB.  
（2）Train_PyTorch: Provides the training code implemented using the PyTorch framework.  
（3）Predictor: Includes the integrated predictor.  

1 The researcher needs to store the protein sequence to be predicted into a “.txt” file, the first line stores the name of the protein sequence, the second line is the long sequence of the protein to be predicted.
